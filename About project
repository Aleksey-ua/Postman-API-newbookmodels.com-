One of the last experience that I had in QA testing was Web-based social network professional application.
This App Like Linkedin let people meet here people who are looking for a job in fashion buisness and people who ara jobs gives.
So tha App has whide few different types of users:
 - clients (job givers, create projects, castings, diferrent activities); 
 - models (who are looking for a job, they want to applie, they create the portfolio and have the opportunity to find interesting project and job);
 - admin (special user, you can not create this type of users on the App, it is created directly in the data base).
The reason is that the App is very sensitive - its very easy to abuse people, who are vorking in fassion industry.
So each and any users (models or clients) shood be oproved by admin. This is his roles - to review and approve or reject or block different types of users.
