<h1>About project</h1>
One of the last experience that I had in QA testing was Web-based social network professional application.
<br>
This App Like Linkedin let people meet here people who are looking for a job in fashion business and people who are job gives.
<br>
So the App has wide few different types of users:
<br>
 - clients (job givers, create projects, castings, different activities); 
 <br>
 - models (who are looking for a job, they want to apply, they create the portfolio and have the opportunity to find interesting project and job);
 <br>
 - admin (special user, you can not create this type of users on the App, it is created directly in the data base).
 <br>
The reason is that the App is very sensitive â€“ it is very easy to abuse people, who are working in fashion industry.
<br>
So each and any users (models or clients) shood be approved by admin. This is his roles - to review and approve or reject or block different types of users.
<br>
For model only IOs App is available.
<br>
For clients - only Web.
<br>
It is very interesting and kind of challenging.
<br>
Because besides of all typical types of testing that we are running we have to verify is both those version (they use absolutely different technologies, different approach, even different languages - Java vs Swift) are synchronized.
<br>
So if the model is created account via mobile platform the client shood see on the Web that model is here.
